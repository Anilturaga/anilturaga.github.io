		I recently was in a weird situation. I was in Chennai and I had to check out my room at 8AM in the morning from the outskirts of the city. My return train is at 6:30PM. I had to kill 10 hours without knowing a word of Tamil or anything about Chennai apart from the beach.
		<br />
		<br />

		This wasn't particularly new to me. I was in a similar situation a couple of months ago in Pune.
		That time, my girlfriend looked up a bunch of articles on noteworthy places to visit,
		shortlisted some, mapped them all on Google maps to create a timeline factoring in the travel
		time, time spent at a place but still being around the final destination (which was the airport).
		<br />
		<br />
		This time however, she isn't available and I am too lazy to put all that effort. I want a peaceful itinerary
		that considers all the above factors without considerable effort from my side.
		<br />
		<br />
		I thought I'd just use AI for the whole process. With web search, any chatbot must be able to automate this process. Right?
		<br />
		<br />
		With nothing to lose but time which is what I wanted, I'd chosen Google Gemini to be my partner.
		Mostly because it's free and 2.5 pro has been pretty nice.
		<br />
		<br />
		Here is the chat transcript and some pictures of my day in Chennai.
